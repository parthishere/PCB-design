\section{Objective / Purpose of Lab}
\begin{enumerate}
	\item One of the key parameters used to characterize VRMs is the Thevenin equivalent circuit model. The Thevenin model represents a voltage source as a combination of an ideal voltage source (Thevenin voltage, VTH) and a series resistance (Thevenin resistance, RTH). This model is particularly useful for analyzing the behavior of VRMs under varying load conditions, as the output voltage and current will depend on the values of VTH and RTH, as well as the load resistance.
	\item 
	\item The objective of this lab is to design, build, and test a custom instrument, the "Instrument Droid," capable of measuring the Thevenin parameters (VTH and RTH) of various voltage sources and regulators as a function of the output current load. By sweeping the load current and measuring the corresponding output voltages, the Instrument Droid can determine the Thevenin voltage (the open-circuit voltage) and the Thevenin resistance (the slope of the voltage-current curve).

	\item To precisely control the voltage across the sense resistor, and consequently the current through the MOSFET, an external digital-to-analog converter (DAC) is utilized. The DAC, in this case, the MCP4725, receives digital inputs from an Arduino microcontroller and generates an analog voltage output proportional to the desired current level.

	\item the Instrument Droid incorporates a high-resolution analog-to-digital converter (ADC), specifically the ADS1115, to measure the voltage across the sense resistor and the loaded output voltage of the VRM. By employing differential voltage measurement techniques, the ADC can accurately capture the voltage drops across the sense resistor and the VRM, even in the presence of noise or ground offsets.

	\item To account for potential power dissipation issues, especially when characterizing high-current VRMs, the Instrument Droid implements a pulsed current measurement approach. By applying short current pulses with low duty cycles, the average power dissipation in the circuit components can be maintained within safe operating limits, preventing overheating and potential damage.

\begin{itemize}

  \item In this circuit configuration, the operational amplifier (op-amp) is crucial for its role in controlling the MOSFET as a voltage-controlled current source. The op-amp is set up in a non-inverting configuration, where its output is fed back to its inverting input through a voltage divider formed by R3 and R4. This feedback loop allows the op-amp to adjust its output voltage to match the input voltage, effectively functioning as a voltage follower.
  \item The DAC, controlled by a microcontroller, generates an analog voltage proportional to the desired current level. This voltage signal is applied to the non-inverting input of the op-amp, serving as the reference voltage for the op-amp's negative feedback loop. That is why we are giving it stable output thorough DAC IC
  \item we are using voltage divider for measuring VRM voltage as ADS1115 is only capable of measuring 5 V , voltage sources higher than 5 v will burn the ADS11115 that is why we are using voltage divider
  \item In this circuit, V\_current and V\_VRM are used to measure the current through the VRM and the VRM's output voltage, respectively. These measurements are essential for determining the Thevenin equivalent of the VRM.
  \item Measuring V\_current (Voltage across R\_sense):\\
  The voltage across the sense resistor (R\_sense) is directly proportional to the current flowing through it, according to Ohm's law: V = I x R. By measuring the voltage across R\_sense using the microcontroller's ADC and knowing the value of R\_sense, we can calculate the current through the VRM:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item I\_VRM = V\_current / R\_sense
    \item This current measurement allows us to characterize the VRM's behavior under different load conditions.
  \end{itemize}
  \item Measuring V\_VRM:\\
  V\_VRM represents the output voltage of the VRM. However, the VRM's output voltage may be too high for the microcontroller's ADC to measure directly. To overcome this, a voltage divider consisting of resistors R3 and R4 is used to scale down the VRM voltage to a level suitable for the ADC.
  The scaled VRM voltage (V\_VRM\_scaled) is given by:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item V\_VRM\_scaled = V\_VRM $\cdot$ $\frac{R4}{(R3 + R4)}$
    \item By measuring V\_VRM\_scaled using the ADC and knowing the values of R3 and R4, we can calculate the actual VRM output voltage:
    \item V\_VRM = V\_VRM\_scaled $\cdot$ $\frac{(R3 + R4)}{R4}$
  \end{itemize}
  \item Op-amp usage:\\
  \begin{itemize}
    \item The op-amp in this circuit is configured as a non-inverting amplifier, which serves as a voltage-controlled current source (VCCS) for the MOSFET. The DAC output voltage is applied to the non-inverting input of the op-amp, and the inverting input is connected to the sense resistor (R\_sense).
  
    \item The op-amp tries to maintain the same voltage at both its inputs by adjusting its output voltage. This forces the voltage across R\_sense to be equal to the DAC output voltage. As a result, the current through R\_sense, and consequently the current through the MOSFET and VRM, is controlled by the DAC output voltage.
    
    \item The op-amp also provides a high input impedance, ensuring that it doesn't load the DAC output, and a low output impedance, enabling it to drive the MOSFET gate effectively.
  \end{itemize}
  \item MOSFET usage:\\
  \begin{itemize}
    \item The MOSFET acts as a voltage-controlled current source in this circuit. The op-amp output voltage, which is controlled by the DAC, is applied to the MOSFET's gate. The MOSFET's drain current (I\_D) is proportional to the gate-source voltage (V\_GS) when operating in the saturation region.
  
    \item By varying the DAC output voltage, the op-amp adjusts the MOSFET's gate voltage, thus controlling the current through the MOSFET and, consequently, the current through the VRM. This allows the microcontroller to set different load currents and measure the VRM's response.
    
    \item The MOSFET is chosen for its high input impedance, which minimizes loading on the op-amp output, and its ability to handle large currents required for characterizing the VRM.
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}


In summary, the op-amp and MOSFET work together as a voltage-controlled current source to regulate the current through the VRM, while V\_current and V\_VRM measurements provide the necessary data for determining the VRM's Thevenin equivalent.

Here's a breakdown of the code:
\begin{itemize}
  \item It iterates over a specified number of points (npts) with increasing load currents (I\_A).
  For each iteration: a. It calls func\_meas\_off() to measure the VRM voltage (V\_VRM\_off\_v) and current (I\_sense\_off\_A) when no load is applied. b. It calls func\_meas\_on() to apply the desired load current (I\_A) and measure the corresponding VRM voltage (V\_VRM\_on\_v) and current (I\_sense\_on\_A). c. It calculates the load current (I\_load\_A), Thevenin equivalent voltage (V\_VRM\_thevenin\_v), loaded VRM voltage (V\_VRM\_loaded\_v), and Thevenin resistance (R\_thevenin). d. It prints the measurement results (iteration, load current, Thevenin voltage, loaded voltage, Thevenin resistance). e. It checks if the loaded VRM voltage drops below 75\% of the Thevenin voltage. If so, it stops the ramping process (i = npts) because the VRM is unable to supply more current without significant voltage drop.
  \item The func\_meas\_off() and func\_meas\_on() functions handle the actual measurement process:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item func\_meas\_off() sets the DAC output to 0 (no load), then takes multiple samples of the VRM voltage and current over a specified time period (itime\_off\_msec). It averages the samples to obtain V\_VRM\_off\_v and I\_sense\_off\_A.
    \item func\_meas\_on() sets the DAC output to apply the desired load current (I\_DAC\_ADU), then takes multiple samples of the VRM voltage and current over a specified time period (itime\_on\_msec). It averages the samples to obtain V\_VRM\_on\_v and I\_sense\_on\_A.
    \item The reason for stopping the ramping process when the loaded VRM voltage drops below 75\% of the Thevenin voltage is to prevent excessive loading of the VRM, which could potentially damage it or cause unreliable measurements. This threshold is a safety measure to ensure that the VRM is not pushed beyond its capable current delivery range.
  \end{itemize}
  
  \item By measuring the Thevenin voltage and resistance at different load currents, this code can characterize the behavior of the VRM, including its output impedance, current-handling capability, and any non-linear effects that may occur at higher currents.
\end{itemize}



\section{Measurement}

The Instrument Droid was used to characterize various voltage sources and regulators, including known sources for verification purposes and unknown sources to demonstrate the instrument's capabilities. This section presents the measurement results and analyses for each source.

\subsection{Function Generator as a Known Source} 

To verify the proper operation of the Instrument Droid, a function generator was initially used as a known voltage source. The function generator was set to provide a constant DC voltage output, and its Thevenin parameters were calculated based on the manufacturer's specifications \& previous labs.\\

Expected Thevenin Resistance (RTH): 50$\ohm$\\

The Instrument Droid was then used to measure the function generator's output voltage and current at various load conditions. The measured data was processed to determine the Thevenin parameters, and the results were compared to the expected values.\\

Measured Value\\
\boxed{Thevenin Resistance (RTH)	: 49.82$\ohm$}\\
The measured Thevenin voltage and resistance closely matched the expected values, confirming the accurate operation of the Instrument Droid.\\

\ref{fig:vrm_block_diagram} shows the plot of the measured Thevenin resistance versus the output current for the function generator.\\

  \caption{Current vs Voltage for function generator}
  \label{fig:function_generator}
\end{figure}

As expected, the Thevenin resistance remained relatively constant across the measured current range, consist  ent with the low output impedance of the function generator, slope of this graph gives us R\_th which is 50ohm in our case

The Instrument Droid was then used to measure the Voltage Supply set at 5V  voltage and current at various load conditions. The measured data was processed to determine the Thevenin parameters, and the results were compared to the expected values.\\


Measured Value\\
\boxed{Thevenin Resistance (RTH)	: 0.95$\ohm$}\\
The measured Thevenin voltage and resistance closely matched the expected values, confirming the accurate operation of the Instrument Droid.\\

\subsection{Bench Power Supply with Known Resistance} 

To further validate the Instrument Droid's measurements, a bench power supply was used with a known series resistor added. This configuration allowed for a predictable Thevenin resistance to be measured.\\

Added Series Resistor: 10$\ohm$ \\
Expected Thevenin Resistance (RTH): 1$\ohm$ +10$\ohm$  = 11$\ohm$ \\

Measured Value	\\
\boxed{Thevenin Resistance 11$\ohm$} \\
The measured Thevenin voltage and resistance closely matched the expected values, further confirming the accuracy of the Instrument Droid's measurements.\\

Figure \ref{vs10} shows the plot of the measured Thevenin resistance versus the output current for the modified bench power supply.\\
