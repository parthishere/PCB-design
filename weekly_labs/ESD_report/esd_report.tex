\section{Explanation}

Electrostatic discharge (ESD) is a common phenomenon that occurs when two materials, typically insulators, are rubbed together, causing triboelectric charge separation. This charge separation leads to the buildup of static electric fields, which can induce voltages and currents in nearby conductors. In the context of electronics manufacturing and handling, ESD events can cause significant damage to sensitive components, leading to reduced performance or complete failure.\\

This lab aims to provide a hands-on understanding of ESD principles and mitigation techniques using an Arduino-based electrostatic field (E-field) meter. By constructing a simple yet effective E-field meter, participants will be able to visualize the presence of static electric fields in their environment and investigate the factors that contribute to charge buildup.\\

The E-field meter consists of an Arduino Uno microcontroller board connected to a short antenna wire. The antenna acts as a conductor that experiences charge induction in the presence of static electric fields. The Arduino's analog-to-digital converter (ADC) reads the voltage induced on the antenna, allowing the microcontroller to measure the strength of the surrounding E-field.\\

To enhance the sensitivity of the E-field meter, a digital filtering technique is employed. The Arduino sketch is programmed to take ADC readings as quickly as possible and average them over an integer number of power line cycles (PLC). the power line frequency is 60 Hz, corresponding to a cycle duration of approximately 16.67 milliseconds. By averaging the ADC readings over a period that is an exact multiple of the power line cycle, any 60 Hz background noise is effectively cancelled out, revealing the underlying static E-field signal.\\

\begin{enumerate}
  \item Electrostatic Discharge (ESD): ESD refers to the sudden flow of electricity between two objects at different electrical potentials, caused by direct contact or induced by an electrostatic field. In the context of electronics, ESD events can cause damage to sensitive components, leading to performance issues or complete failure.
  \item Triboelectric Charge Separation: Triboelectric charge separation is the process by which certain materials become electrically charged when they are rubbed together or come into contact with each other. This occurs due to the transfer of electrons between the materials, resulting in one material gaining a positive charge and the other a negative charge.
  \item Static Electric Fields: Static electric fields are regions in space where an electric charge experiences a force due to the presence of other charges. These fields are created by the accumulation of electric charges on the surface of objects or materials, often as a result of triboelectric charging.
  \item Electrostatic Field (E-field) Meter: An E-field meter is a device used to measure the strength and polarity of static electric fields in the environment. In this lab, an Arduino Uno microcontroller board is used in conjunction with a short antenna wire to create a simple E-field meter.
  \item ESD-safe Mat and Wrist Strap: ESD-safe mats and wrist straps are tools used to create a static-free work environment. The mat provides a conductive surface that is connected to ground, allowing static charges to dissipate. The wrist strap connects the user to the mat or directly to ground, ensuring that the user and the components being handled are at the same potential, minimizing the risk of ESD damage.
\end{enumerate}


\section{Code}



\begin{lstlisting}
  int pinADC = A0;
  int nPLC = 1;
  long iTime2Average_usec = (1000000.0 * nPLC ) / 60.0;
  float V_ADU;
  long nCountsActual;
  long iTimeStart_usec;
  long iTime2Stop_usec;

  void setup() {
  Serial.begin(1000000);
  for (int i = 1; i < 3000; i++) {
    V_ADU = analogRead(pinADC);
  }
}

void loop() {
  V_ADU = 0.0;
  nCountsActual = 0;
  iTimeStart_usec = micros();
  iTime2Stop_usec = iTimeStart_usec + iTime2Average_usec;

  while (micros() < iTime2Stop_usec) {
    V_ADU = V_ADU + analogReadFast(pinADC) * 1.0;
    nCountsActual++;
  }

  V_ADU = V_ADU / nCountsActual;

  Serial.print(V_ADU);
  Serial.println();

  Serial.print(V_ADU);
  Serial.print(",\t");
  Serial.print(0); Serial.print(", ");
  Serial.print(200);
  Serial.println();
}

\end{lstlisting}

In the setup() function, the code initializes serial communication at a baud rate of 1,000,000 and takes 3000 dummy ADC readings to stabilize the ADC input and remove any initial transient artifacts.\\

In the loop() function, the code performs the following steps: a. Initializes V\_ADU and nCountsActual to zero, and records the start time (iTimeStart\_usec) using the micros() function. b. Calculates the stop time (iTime2Stop\_usec) by adding the desired averaging period (iTime2Average\_usec) to the start time. c. Enters a while loop that continuously reads the ADC value using analogReadFast(pinADC), adds it to V\_ADU, and increments nCountsActual until the current time exceeds the stop time. d. Calculates the average ADC value by dividing V\_ADU by nCountsActual. e. Prints the averaged ADC value to the serial monitor and serial plotter. The serial plotter output includes the averaged value, as well as fixed scale values (0 and 200) to prevent auto-scaling.




\section{Measurement}

\subsection{Baseline E-field Meter Readings}
Before introducing any charged objects near the E-field meter, I observed the baseline readings to ensure that the meter was functioning correctly and to establish a reference point for future measurements.
\begin{itemize}
  \item With no charged objects nearby, the E-field meter readings were stable and close to zero, typically fluctuating between -40 ADU (analog-to-digital units).
  \item The presence of a 60Hz signal from nearby electrical sources was detected as periodic noise in the readings.
  \item To remove this periodic noise, I implemented a digital filtering technique that averages the readings over a whole period of the 60Hz signal.
        \begin{figure}[H]
          \centering
          \includegraphics[scale=0.2]{figures/periodic_noise.png}
          \caption{60Hz signal}
        \end{figure}

        \begin{figure}[H]
          \centering
          \includegraphics[scale=0.2]{figures/periodic_noise2.png}
          \caption{60Hz signal}
        \end{figure}

\end{itemize}
\subsection{Initial Readings with Averaging}
When I first started taking measurements with averaging
\begin{itemize}
  \item At the start, without enough readings to plot the data, I observed peaks in the readings. These peaks were caused by the insufficient data points for proper averaging.
  \item As I continued to take more readings over time, the peaks gradually diminished, and the readings became more stable. This stabilization was a result of the increasing number of data points being averaged.
  \item To further improve the stability of the readings, I introduced a slight delay by taking some dummy readings at the beginning. This delay allowed the averaging process to stabilize before I started plotting the actual data, resulting in fewer peaks and a more stable signal.
        \begin{figure}[H]
          \centering
          \includegraphics[scale=0.2]{figures/initial_peak.png}
          \caption{Without adding dummy readings at first}
        \end{figure}

        \begin{figure}[H]
          \centering
          \includegraphics[scale=0.2]{figures/after_stabilizing.png}
          \caption{After Adding dummy readings in setup()}
        \end{figure}

        \begin{table}[H]
          \centering
          \begin{tabular}{|c|c|}
            \hline
            Initial peak without dummy Readings & Initial readings with dummy readings \\
            \hline
            400 ADU                             & 40 ADU                               \\
            \hline
          \end{tabular}
        \end{table}

\end{itemize}
\subsection{Triboelectric Charging}
Triboelectric charging occurs when two different materials are rubbed together, causing electrons to transfer from one material to the other. This transfer of electrons results in the accumulation of static charges on the surfaces of the materials. I investigated this phenomenon using various materials and observed the corresponding changes in the E-field meter readings.
\begin{itemize}
  \item Rubbing Scale against hair: When a scale was rubbed against the experimenter's hair and brought near the E-field meter antenna, the readings showed a strong negative polarity, with peaks reaching -1000 ADU. This indicates that the scale acquired a large negative charge through triboelectric charging.
        \begin{figure}[H]
          \centering
          \includegraphics[scale=0.2]{figures/scale.png}
          \caption{Charged Scale}
        \end{figure}

  \item Rubbing hand against hair: When a hand was rubbed against the experimenter's hair and brought near the E-field meter antenna, the readings showed a strong negative polarity, with peaks reaching -200 ADU. This indicates that the hand acquired a negative charge through triboelectric charging.
        \begin{figure}[H]
          \centering
          \includegraphics[scale=0.2]{figures/hand.png}
          \caption{Charged Hand}
        \end{figure}

        \begin{table}[H]
          \centering
          \begin{tabular}{|c|c|}
            \hline
            Charged Hand & Charged Scale \\
            \hline
            900 ADU      & 80 ADU        \\
            \hline
          \end{tabular}
        \end{table}

\end{itemize}
These experiments demonstrate how triboelectric charging can generate significant static charges on various materials, which can be detected and measured using the E-field meter.
\subsection{ESD Mitigation Techniques}
To minimize the risk of ESD damage to sensitive electronic components, it is essential to implement effective ESD mitigation techniques.
\begin{itemize}
  \item Grounding: When a charged object was touched to a grounded metal surface, the E-field meter readings quickly returned to the baseline level (-40 ADU). This rapid return to the baseline indicates that the static charges were effectively dissipated through grounding, neutralizing the object's charge.

        \begin{figure}[H]
          \centering
          \includegraphics[scale=0.2]{figures/hand_when_touching_groung.png}
          \caption{The falling edge when I touch ground with hand close the antenna}
        \end{figure}

        \begin{table}[H]
          \centering
          \begin{tabular}{|c|c|}
            \hline
            Without Grounding & With Grounding \\
            \hline
            80 ADU            & 40 ADU         \\
            \hline
          \end{tabular}
        \end{table}



\end{itemize}
These observations highlight the importance of proper ESD mitigation techniques in preventing the buildup of harmful static charges that can damage sensitive electronics.
\subsection{Distance and Orientation Effects}
The distance and orientation of the charged object relative to the E-field meter antenna play a significant role in the magnitude of the readings.
\begin{itemize}
  \item Distance: As the charged object was brought closer to the antenna, the E-field meter readings increased in magnitude. Conversely, moving the object away from the antenna resulted in a decrease in the readings. This relationship between distance and field strength is consistent with the inverse square law, which states that the magnitude of an electric field decreases with the square of the distance from the charge.


        \begin{figure}[H]
          \centering
          \includegraphics[scale=0.2]{figures/large_distance.png}
          \caption{Large Distance between scale and antenna(about 10cm)}
        \end{figure}

        \begin{figure}[H]
          \centering
          \includegraphics[scale=0.2]{figures/scale.png}
          \caption{Small Distance between scale and antenna(about 2cm)}
        \end{figure}

        \begin{table}[H]
          \centering
          \begin{tabular}{|c|c|}
            \hline
            Distance & ESD Voltage \\
            \hline
            10cm     & 90 ADU      \\
            2cm      & 900 ADU     \\

            \hline
          \end{tabular}
        \end{table}


  \item Orientation: The orientation of the charged object relative to the antenna also influenced the readings. When the charged surface was parallel to the antenna, the highest readings were observed. In contrast, when the charged surface was perpendicular to the antenna, lower readings were recorded. This difference in readings can be attributed to the direction of the electric field lines emanating from the charged surface.



        \begin{figure}[H]
          \centering
          \includegraphics[scale=0.2]{figures/scale.png}
          \caption{Scale parallel to antenna}
        \end{figure}

        \begin{figure}[H]

          \includegraphics[scale=0.2]{figures/scale_perpenndicular.png}
          \caption{Scale perpendicular to antenna}
        \end{figure}


        \begin{table}[H]
          \centering
          \begin{tabular}{|c|c|}
            \hline
            Orientation              & ESD charge \\
            \hline
            Perpendicular to antenna & 550 ADU    \\
            Parallel                 & 900 ADU    \\

            \hline
          \end{tabular}
        \end{table}


\end{itemize}
Understanding the effects of distance and orientation on the E-field meter readings is crucial for accurately interpreting the results and optimizing the placement of the antenna in ESD-sensitive environments.
