\section{Objective / Purpose of Lab}

The goal of this laboratory exercise is to build and analyze a circuit using two types of 555 timer ICs, one fast and one slow. The main tasks include:

\begin{enumerate}
	\item Construct a circuit with a fast 555 timer IC, and then replace it with a slow 555 timer IC. Observe and compare the rise and fall times of the output signals, the waveform shapes, and the output voltage levels in two scenarios: driving an open circuit and driving a circuit with a 50 ohm resistor and LED in series.
	\item Modify the circuit to drive an LED using three different series resistors: 50 ohms, 1k ohms, and 10k ohms. Record the differences in the output voltage for each resistor value.
	\item Using an oscilloscope with a 10x probe, measure the rise and fall time of the 555 timer output for each IC type, both with and without the 50 ohm resistor and LED. Also, determine the frequency and duty cycle of the output signal. These measurements should first be estimated visually before using the scopeâ€™s cursor or measurement functions for accuracy.
	\item Compare the observed values with the predicted values for frequency and duty cycle, noting any significant differences or insights gained.
\end{enumerate}


This exercise aims to develop a practical understanding of the 555 timer IC's behavior in different configurations and load conditions.

\section{Napkin Sketch}

Circuit given in the lab manual can give us approx 60\% 
of duty cycle, So I have come up with my circuit to make the circuit work at 50\% duty cycle and also be able to vary the circuit

for simple circuit we can see that the overall time for one cycle would be
\begin{flalign*}
	& T_{total} = T_{charging} + T_{discharging}&& \\\\
	& \textbf{And expanding each timing term would give us,}&& \\
	&T_{charging} = 0.693 \cdot(R_1 + R_2) \cdot C&& \\
	& T_{discharging} = 0.693 \cdot(R_2) \cdot C&& \\\\
	&\textbf{so the total time for charging and Discharging would be, }&& \\
	&T_{total} = 0.693 \cdot(R_1 + R_2) \cdot C + 0.693 \cdot(R_2) \cdot C&& \\
	&T_{total} = 0.693 \cdot(R_1 +  2 \cdot R_2) \cdot C&& \\
\end{flalign*}



I have used bypass diode to remove resistance R2 while discharging the Capacitor so R2 would be removed from the equation and equation would become just,
\begin{flalign*}
&T_{charging} = 0.693 \cdot(R_1 + R_2) \cdot C&& \\
&T_{discharging} = 0.693 \cdot C&& \\\\
&T_{total} = 0.693 \cdot(R_1 + R_2) \cdot C&& \\
\end{flalign*}

Here is the schematic with bypass diode to reduce the time 
for discharging the cap
\begin{figure}[!h]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[scale=0.8]{figures/timer_sch}
	\caption{Schematic for variable duty-cycle 555 Timer}
	\label{555_schematic}
\end{figure}

\pagebreak
\section{Calculations}

Equation for schematic with bypass diode is,
\begin{gather}
	T_{total} = 0.693 \cdot(R_1 + R_2) \cdot C
\end{gather}

We need 50\% duty cycle so we will assume that $T_{charging}$ and $T_{discharging}$ is same.
\begin{flalign*}
	& T_{charging} = T_{discharging}&& \\
	& 0.693 \cdot(R_1 + R_2) \cdot C = 0.693 \cdot C&& \\
	& R_1 = R_2 \textit{(negative sign implies Current in reverse direction)}
\end{flalign*}

We need 500Hz frequency and we are assuming C as 0.1$\mu$F putting this value in the equation and putting $R_1 = R_2$ 	
\begin{flalign*}
	& T_{total} = 0.693 \cdot(R_1 + R_2) \cdot C && \\
	& \left(\frac{1}{500} \right) = 0.693 \cdot(R_1 + R_2) \cdot C && \\
	& \left( \frac{0.002}{0.693} \right) = 2 \cdot R_1 \cdot 0.1 \cdot 10^{-6} && \\
	& \boxed{R_1 = 15k\ohm} && \\
\end{flalign*}

So, I have added $R_2$ as 15k ohm and $R_1$ is variable Potentiometer of 10k$\ohm$ so that we can change the output frequency.

\section{Scope shots with analysis}

Below Schematic \ref{cap} shows charging discharging of capactor at constant rate, it shows that it will start charging at 1/3 V and start discharging at 2/3 V .

\end{figure}

Below referance scope image \ref{overall_duty_cycle} is denoting frequency of 499.22Hz and duty cycle of 48\% with setting potentiometer to match $R_2$ that is 15k.

\end{figure}


Here you can see in the image \ref{555_slow} the rise and fall time of \textbf{Fast} 555 timer IC is around 30ns and 40ns.

\end{figure}


Here you can see in the image \ref{555_slow} the rise and fall time of \textbf{Slow} 555 timer IC is around 30ns and 22ns.

\end{figure}


After setting knob to highest resistance we can see that the duty cycle increases to max of around 92\%. see image \ref{90_duty}
\begin{figure}[H]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[scale=0.6]{figures/90_duty}
	\caption{duty cycle = 92\%}
	\label{90_duty}
\end{figure}

After setting knob to highest resistance we can see that the duty cycle increases to max of around 92\%. see image \ref{0_duty}
\begin{figure}[H]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[scale=0.6]{figures/0_duty}
	\caption{duty cycle = 0.07\%}
	\label{0_duty}
\end{figure}


Also for the Current Consumption here is the

\begin{table}[H]
	\centering

	\begin{tabular}{l c c}

		\textbf{Component Name}&\textbf{Rise Time}&\textbf{Fall Time}\\\hline
		&&\\
		\textbf{NE555 fast}&29ns&22ns\\
		\textbf{NE555 slow}&30ns&44ns\\

	\end{tabular}
	\caption{Rise-time and Fall-time}
	\label{tab_rise_fall}
\end{table}

and Rise time and fall time for both IC is mentioned below

\begin{table}[H]
	\centering

	\begin{tabular}{l c c c}
		\textbf{}&\textbf{50$\ohm$}&\textbf{1k$\ohm$}&\textbf{10k$\ohm$}\\\hline
		&&\\
		\textbf{Current}&3.11 mA&728 $\mu$A&94 $\mu$A\\
		\textbf{Voltage}&2.630 V&2.745 V&2.847V\\
	\end{tabular}
	\caption{Current Consumption}
	\label{tab_curent_consumption}
\end{table}

This is happening as the datasheet suggest that the slow 555 would give large current draw and current sink in the output and fast one will have faster rise time and fall time but it would not be able to draw much current, more that 50mA from output
