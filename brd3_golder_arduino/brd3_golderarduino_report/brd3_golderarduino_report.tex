\section{Introduction}


This lab aims to teach students how to design and build a working electronic device from start to finish. The main objective is to provide hands-on experience in the different steps involved in creating a prototype.\\

we start by drawing a simple diagram of the circuit they want to build on a piece of paper. Then creating the PCB in altium designer\\

After building the board, test it to make sure it works as planned. Use tools like multimeters and oscilloscopes to measure voltages and signals. If something doesn't work right, figure out what's wrong and fix it.\\

\textbf{Measurements to be Conducted:}

\begin{enumerate}
	\item \textbf{Oscilloscope Analysis:} Use an oscilloscope equipped with a 10x probe to observe the rise time fall time of switching noise on the power rail due to switching of pins
	\item \textbf{Noise Measurement:} Examine the noise on power rail with slammer circuit to see difference between held high pin with software and local power
	\item \textbf{current measurement:} measure the current going thorough slammer 10ohm resistor.
	\item \textbf{current measurement:} measure the current going thorough slammer 47ohm resistor.
\end{enumerate}

For the construction, 1206 size surface-mount device (SMD) components were chosen and soldered onto a printed circuit board (PCB).

\section{Project Plan}
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Using Micro B usb instead of Mini B
	\item Integrate an external power source connector for a 5V AC to DC adapter to supply power to the circuit board.
	\item Implement a voltage converter to step down from 5V to 3.3V using LDO.
	\item Functionality to measure the in-rush current.
	\item Design header layout in such a way that it could be compatable with all the arduino shields.
	\item Use isolation of circuit with three pin switches
	\item Use as less cross under as possible without making size bigger
	\item Employ red LEDs and 50 ohm resistors as loads for three of the switch outputs from each hex inverter.
	\item Calculate the current consumption of slammer 50 ohm resistor.
	\item Use same size of commercial Layouts.
	\item Design one side of the printed circuit board (PCB) using optimal layout practices and the opposite side with suboptimal layout techniques. In the less effective layout, position the decoupling capacitors significantly away from the Vcc pin.
	\item  Ensure consistent component placement and routing across both sections of the PCB, with the exception of the decoupling capacitor's positioning.
	\item  Establish test points for the following signals:
	      \begin{itemize}
		      \item 5V test point
		      \item test point at 3.3V
		      \item Voltage across D+ pin of usb
		      \item Voltage across SCL line
		      \item Voltage across arduino RX
		      \item Voltage across arduino TX
	      \end{itemize}

	\item Add a decoupling capacitor for the Atmega328P IC to mitigate switching noise.
	\item Add a Ferrite Bead (LC low pass filter) to Analog Reference for the Atmega328P.
	\item Implement a copper pour for the ground plane to enhance circuit stability.
	\item Incorporate indicator lights, testing points, and isolation switches for comprehensive functionality and diagnostic capabilities.
\end{enumerate}



\section{Risk Management}
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Signal lines will have a width of 6 mils to maintain signal integrity.
	\item Power lines will be designed with a width of 20 mils to distinguish them easily and support adequate current flow.
	\item Test points will be strategically placed and clearly labeled for easy identification.
	\item Isolation switches will be installed at each stage to facilitate troubleshooting and debugging.
	\item Use appropriate voltage regulators (e.g., AMS1117) to provide stable and regulated power to the components.
	\item Include sufficient decoupling capacitors near power pins of ICs to minimize noise and ensure stable power delivery.
	\item Use a TVS diode (SRV05-4) to protect against voltage spikes and transients.
	\item Select a reliable USB to Serial converter (e.g., CH340G) with good driver support.
	\item Ensure proper routing of USB data lines (D+ and D-) to minimize signal integrity issues.
	\item Provide sufficient ground connections and shielding to reduce noise and interference on USB lines
	\item Choose appropriate crystal oscillators (e.g., 16MHz and 12MHz) based on the requirements of the microcontroller and CH340 components and add load resistor for high impedance.
	\item Place the crystal oscillators close to the microcontroller to minimize trace lengths and ensure stable clock signals.
	\item Design the PCB layout with manufacturability in mind, following design rules and guidelines provided by the PCB manufacturer.

\subsection{Schematic Overview}


\begin{figure}[H]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[scale=0.5]{figures/schematic.png}
	\caption{Schematic}
\end{figure}

\begin{enumerate}
	\item \textbf{Power Supply:}\\
	      I will be using USB micro B for the power USB instead of USB mini B\\

	      The schematic includes two power input options: a USB Micro connector and a power jack. The USB Micro connector allows the system to be powered through a USB connection, while the power jack enables the use of an external power supply. The power source selection is controlled by a switch, which determines whether the system is powered via USB or the external power jack.\\

	      The incoming power is then regulated using a 3.3V LDO (Low Dropout) voltage regulator. The LDO takes the input voltage (either from USB or the power jack) and steps it down to a stable 3.3V, which is used to power the microcontroller and other components in the system. The LDO ensures a clean and regulated power supply, minimizing noise and voltage fluctuations.

	\item \textbf{USB to TTL (CH340):}\\The schematic includes a USB to TTL converter based on the CH340 chip. This subsystem enables serial communication between the microcontroller and a computer or other USB host. The CH340 chip converts USB signals to TTL (Transistor-Transistor Logic) levels and vice versa, allowing the microcontroller to communicate with the USB host.\\

	      The USB data lines (D+ and D-) are connected to the CH340 chip, which handles the USB protocol and data transfer. The chip also provides the necessary signals for USB enumeration and handshaking. The converted TTL signals (RX and TX) are then connected to the corresponding pins of the microcontroller for serial communication.
	\item \textbf{Microcontroller (ATMega328):}\\
	      The heart of the system is the ATMega328 microcontroller. It is a powerful 8-bit microcontroller from the AVR family, widely used in Arduino boards. The microcontroller is responsible for executing the programmed instructions, controlling peripherals, and managing the overall functionality of the system.\\

	      The schematic shows the ATMega328 with its various pin connections. The power pins (VCC and GND) are connected to the regulated 3.3V supply and ground, respectively. The ICSP (In-Circuit Serial Programming) header is provided for programming the microcontroller using an external programmer.
	\item \textbf{Oscillators:}\\
	      The schematic includes two crystal oscillators: a 16MHz crystal and a 12MHz crystal. These oscillators provide the necessary clock signals for the microcontroller and other timing-dependent components. The 16MHz crystal is the primary clock source for the ATMega328, determining its operating speed and timing characteristics. The 12MHz crystal may be used for other purposes or as an alternative clock source if required.\\

	      The oscillators are connected to the corresponding pins of the microcontroller (XTAL1 and XTAL2) along with the necessary load capacitors. The load capacitors help to stabilize the oscillator's frequency and ensure reliable operation.
	\item \textbf{Debug LEDs:}\\
	      The schematic includes two debug LEDs connected to the microcontroller. These LEDs are useful for visual feedback and debugging purposes during development. They can be controlled by the microcontroller to indicate various states, errors, or progress of the system.\\

	      The LEDs are connected to the microcontroller's GPIO (General Purpose Input/Output) pins through current-limiting resistors. The resistors ensure that the LEDs operate within their specified current ratings and protect the microcontroller's pins from excessive current draw.
	\item \textbf{ICSP (In-Circuit Serial Programming):}\\
	      The ICSP header provides a means to program the microcontroller using an external programmer. It allows for direct access to the microcontroller's programming interface, enabling firmware updates, debugging, and initial programming.\\

	      The ICSP header includes the necessary pins for programming, such as MOSI (Master Out Slave In), MISO (Master In Slave Out), SCK (Serial Clock), and RESET. These pins are connected to the corresponding pins of the microcontroller, allowing the programmer to communicate with the microcontroller and transfer the program code.
	\item \textbf{Test Points:}\\
	      The schematic includes several test points strategically placed at various locations. Test points are small pads or connectors that provide access to specific signals or voltages for testing and measurement purposes. They allow developers to easily probe and monitor the system's behavior during development and debugging.\\

	      The test points in this schematic are connected to important signals such as the power supply voltages (3.3V and GND), the ICSP signals (SCK, MOSI, MISO), and the serial communication signals (RX and TX). These test points facilitate the use of oscilloscopes, logic analyzers, or multimeters to analyze and troubleshoot the system.
\end{enumerate}


\subsection{Layout Considerations}
For the PCB layout, several factors are critical:

\begin{enumerate}
	\item \textbf{Test Probes:} Designated points for measuring power rail voltage, the output from the 555 timer, and the voltage across a 1k resistor. Each test point is accessible via individual switches for isolation.
	\item \textbf{Decoupling Capacitor and Ferrite bead:} Positioned as close to the ATMega328 timer IC as possible to minimize switching noise and stabilize the power supply to the IC.
	\item \textbf{Ground Pour:} Implementing a ground pour around signal and power traces to enhance signal integrity and provide a better return path for signals, reducing interference and improving circuit performance.
\end{enumerate}

	\caption{Noise Shield used for taking reading}
\end{figure}



below is the details of the power section, Atmega328 microcontroller, test probes, and oscillator sections of the PCB layout, and how they are interconnected based on the schematic.

\begin{enumerate}
	\item Power Section:
	      \begin{itemize}
		      \item In the schematic, the power section includes a barrel jack connector and a USB connector for power input. The PCB layout reflects these components as J3 (barrel jack) and J1 (USB connector).
		      \item The power from the barrel jack and USB connector is routed to the voltage regulator (U1) on the PCB. The voltage regulator is responsible for converting the input voltage to a stable 3.3V supply for the microcontroller and other components.
		      \item On the PCB, the power traces from the input connectors to the voltage regulator are typically wider to handle higher currents and reduce voltage drops. The output of the voltage regulator is then distributed to the microcontroller and other parts of the circuit through power traces.
		      \item The schematic also includes decoupling capacitors near the power input and voltage regulator to filter out noise and stabilize the power supply. These capacitors are placed close to the respective components on the PCB layout to minimize trace lengths and improve power stability.
	      \end{itemize}



	\item Atmega328 Microcontroller:
	      \begin{itemize}
		      \item The Atmega328 microcontroller (U2) is the central component of the Arduino clone. In the schematic, the microcontroller is shown with its various pin connections.

		      \item On the PCB layout, the Atmega328 is positioned strategically to minimize trace lengths and facilitate easy routing of signals. The power pins (VCC and GND) of the microcontroller are connected to the regulated 3.3V supply and ground, respectively, through the power traces.

		      \item The other pins of the microcontroller, such as the digital I/O pins, analog input pins, and communication pins (e.g., UART, SPI, I2C), are routed to their respective headers or connectors on the PCB. The trace lengths are kept as short as possible to minimize signal integrity issues and reduce noise.

		      \item The ICSP header (J2) is connected to the appropriate pins of the Atmega328 to enable in-circuit programming and debugging. The traces for the ICSP signals (MISO, MOSI, SCK, and RESET) are routed carefully to ensure reliable programming and communication.
	      \end{itemize}

	\item Crystal Oscillators:
	      There are two crystal oscillators located near the microcontroller, labeled as "Y1" (16MHz) and "Y2" (12MHz).\\
	      The proximity of the oscillators to the microcontroller minimizes trace lengths and ensures stable clock signals.
	\item Voltage Regulator:
	      The voltage regulator, likely a 3.3V LDO (Low Dropout), is labeled as "U1".
	      The regulator is positioned close to the power input and has input and output feedback capacitor to stable the output (reduce ringing)
	\item USB Interface:
	      The USB interface is located on the left side of the board, labeled as "J1".
	\item Power Input:
	      The power input section includes a barrel jack connector (J3) and a USB connector (J1), providing options for powering the board.
	\item ICSP Header:\textbf{(There is an error in the ICSP routing/ Hard error)}
	      The ICSP (In-Circuit Serial Programming) header is labeled as "J2".\\
	      The ICSP header allows for direct programming of the microcontroller using an external programmer.
	\item Headers and Connectors:
	      The layout includes several headers and connectors for interfacing with external devices and peripherals.\\
	      These include headers for power (J4, J5), analog inputs (J6), and digital inputs/outputs (J7, J8).
	\item Ground Plane:
	      The PCB layout incorporates a solid ground plane, which helps to reduce noise, improve signal integrity, and provide a low-impedance return path for currents.
\end{enumerate}




\section{Code / Bootloading }
Connect ARDUINO pins to new Atmega328P for bootloading
here is the wiring diagram
\begin{figure}[H]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[scale=0.6]{figures/bootload1.png}
	\caption{First time turning on the PCB and selecting good layout}
\end{figure}

UNO 5v ---> ATmega pin 7 (VCC)\\
UNO GND ---> ATmega pin 8 (GND)\\
UNO pin 10 ---> ATmega pin 1 (RESET)\\
UNO pin 11 ---> ATmega pin 17 (MOSI)\\
UNO pin 12 ---> ATmega pin 18 (MISO)\\
UNO pin 13 ---> ATmega pin 19 (SCK)\\

\begin{enumerate}
	\item Each microprocessor has a signature – a unique code that identifies its model. When you bootload a chip (or even upload a sketch) the Arduino IDE checks that the chip selected matches the type it’s connected to. Even though the ATmega328-PU in essence functions in the same way as the ATmega328P-PU, it has a different signature, and one that isn’t recognised by the Arduino IDE.
	\item If we try to bootload an ATmega328-PU, we get a message something along the lines of:\\
	      avrdude: Device signature = 0x1e9514\\
	      avrdude: Expected signature for ATMEGA328P is 1E 95 0F\\
	      Double check chip, or use -F to override this check.\\
	      \begin{figure}[H]
		      \centering
		      \includegraphics[scale=0.6]{figures/bootload_error.png}
		      \caption{First time turning on the PCB and selecting good layout}
	      \end{figure}

	\item The way to work around this is to “trick” the IDE into believing your 328-PU is in fact a 328P-PU. Disclaimer: I have tested this myself and it works.\\
	      \begin{itemize}
		      \item Make a backup copy of the file: avrdude.conf
		      \item Open the file avrdude.conf in a text editor
		      \item Search for: “0x1e 0x95 0x0F” (this is the ATmega328P signature)
		      \item Replace it with: “0x1e 0x95 0x14” (this is the ATmega328 signature)
		      \item Save the file
		      \item Restart the Arduino IDE
		      \item Once bootloading is complete restore the backup copy you made.
	      \end{itemize}
	\item Bootload the ATmega328:\\
	      In the Arduino IDE, from the Tools menu:
	      \begin{itemize}
		      \item under the Board option choose Arduino UNO
		      \item under the Serial Port option ensure the correct port is selected
		      \item under the Programmer option choose Arduino as ISP
		      \item To burn the Bootloader, choose Burn Bootloader from the Tools menu
		      \item we should see a message “Burning bootloader to I/O Board (this may take a minute)"
	      \end{itemize}

	\item Once the bootloader has been burned, you’ll see a message confirming the success. and now we can upload the code directly to golden Arduino
	\item Upload following code
	      \begin{lstlisting}
// the setup function runs once when you press reset or power the board
void setup() {
  // initialize digital pin LED\_BUILTIN as an output.
  pinMode(LED\_BUILTIN, OUTPUT);
}

// the loop function runs over and over again forever
void loop() {
  digitalWrite(LED\_BUILTIN, HIGH);  // turn the LED on (HIGH is the voltage level)
  delay(1000);                      // wait for a second
  digitalWrite(LED\_BUILTIN, LOW);   // turn the LED off by making the voltage LOW
  delay(1000);                      // wait for a second
}
\end{lstlisting}


\end{enumerate}


\textbf{Code for Noise shield}

	DDRB = B00111111;
